# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this application, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Measures Implemented

This application implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Next.js Auth v5 with JWT for secure session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and user roles
- Password hashing with bcrypt using 12 salt rounds
- Rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- Session timeout and secure cookie handling

### Data Protection
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Content sanitization with sanitize-html for user-generated content
- Parametrized queries with Prisma ORM to prevent SQL injection
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- Secure storage of API keys and secrets

### API Security
- CSRF protection for mutating requests
- Rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Secure HTTP headers including Content-Security-Policy
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

### File Uploads
- Validation of file types and sizes
- Scanning for malicious content
- Secure storage with Uploadthing

### Payment Processing
- Server-side validation of payment data
- Secure Stripe integration
- Idempotency keys to prevent duplicate transactions

## Development Security Guidelines

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit .env files to the repository
   - Use .env.example as a template
   - Use strong, unique secrets and keys

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities with `npm audit`
   - Use lockfiles to ensure consistent installations

3. **Code Reviews**
   - All code should be reviewed for security issues
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Be cautious with third-party libraries

4. **Error Handling**
   - Never expose stack traces or detailed error messages to users
   - Log sensitive information securely
   - Use generic error messages in production

5. **Authentication**
   - Use strong password requirements
   - Implement multi-factor authentication when possible
   - Secure password reset flows

6. **Deployment**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Set up proper SSL/TLS configurations
   - Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Security Audit Schedule

Regular security audits should be conducted:
- Automated security scanning: Weekly
- Dependency vulnerability check: Monthly
- Comprehensive security audit: Quarterly
- Penetration testing: Annually

## Compliance

Ensure the application remains compliant with relevant regulations:
- GDPR for EU users
